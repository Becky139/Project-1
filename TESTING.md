## Testing User Stories

#### Current User Goals:

1. As a current user, I want to easily navigate through the site and access the information I require with ease.

  - The navigation bar is clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
  - The hamburger menu is also clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
  - The footer menu is easy to use with appropriate icons for easy identification.

2. As a current user, I want to easily navigate to content I have previously viewed within a small number of steps.

  - On all site pages there is a naviagtion bar, or hambuger menu, with links to each required page.
  - Each information page has links that bring the user to each section of the page.

#### New User Goals

1. As a new user, I want to easily navigate the entire site intuitively.

  - The navigation bar is clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
  - The hamburger menu is also clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
  - The footer menu is easy to use with appropriate icons for easy identification.

2. As a new user, I want the information I seek to be easily accessible and relevant.

  - The navigation bar is clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
  - The hamburger menu is also clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
  - The footer menu is easy to use with appropriate icons for easy identification.

3. As a new user, I want attractive and relevant visuals and colour schemes that work with the content.

  - An attractive colour palette was created using [Color Mind](http://colormind.io/ "Link to Color Mind Home Page").
  - Relavant images were found using [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com "Link to Unsplash Home Page") and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com "Link to Pixabay Home Page").
