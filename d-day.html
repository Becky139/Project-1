            <h2>Normandy Landings</h2>
            <p>
                The Normandy landings were the landing operations and associated airborne operations on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II. Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day, it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the liberation of France (and later western Europe) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front.
                The Allies failed to achieve any of their goals on the first day. Carentan, Saint-LÃ´, and Bayeux remained in German hands, and Caen, a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained a foothold that the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were documented for at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead. Museums, memorials, and war cemeteries in the area now host many visitors each year.

            <p>
                The Atlantic Wall was a wall built under the orders of Hitler that stretched from Norway to Spain. The wall stretched for 1,670 miles and was built to protect Hitler's Europe from attacks by the Allies. The wall took two years to build; construction started in 1942 and ended in 1944. The wall was intially built to just protect ports where Hitler's Navy boats were docked, but building then expanded to many other coastal areas. The cost for the wall in France alone was 3.7 billion Deutschmarks.

            <p>
                Exercise Tiger was a practice for the Normandy invasion. Over 30,000 troops were in attendance for the mock beach landing. The Royal Navy was responsible for protecting the beach where the practice invasion was taking place. On April 28th, German E-Boats attacked Ally tank landing ships in Lyme Bay. One boat caught fire and was abandoned, another sank after being torpedoed, and a third caught fire but made it back to shore. 638 people were killed, while in the actual invasion, only 200 died.

            <h2>Start of Operation Tonga</h2>
            <p>
                Operation Tonga was an airborn operation to gain control of bridges that would be used to help Allied forces advance. The troops were also supposed to destroy the Merville Gun Battery which supposedly held heavy artillery. Due to poor piloting and poor weather conditions, many of the troops were dropped outside of the set area. This caused unnecessary deaths and made the mission more difficult than intended. Even though the troops were depleated, they still destroyed the Murville Battery.

            <p>
                Utah Beach was the codename for the landing area farthest to the west. Utah Beach was 3 miles long and was the farthest west of all of the 5 landing beaches. The beach was located in between Pouppeville and La Madeleine. Although Allied forces did not land where they were supposed to, there was little resistance from Germany. In Omaha Beach however, there was lots of violence.

                Omaha beach was located on the northern coast of France. The beach stretched five miles long and was one of the main landing places for Operation Overlord. The goal was to advance five miles deep inland. They would do this to connect the other landing beaches. These beaches were Gold to the east and Utah to the west.

                Pointe du Hoc is a cliff in Normandy on the northern coast of France. It is 4 miles from Omaha beach and the cliffs raise 100ft above the sea. Point du Hoc had to be destroyed because weapons on top of cliffs could reach landing spots on both Omaha and Utah beach. The US attempted to bomb Pointe du Hoc multiple times but the defenses were too strong, so a ground attack was necessary as well. On d-day, the Germans moved their weapons back exactly one mile and US troops thought them missing.

                Sword beach was another codename for a landing spot for Operation Overlord. It was the landing spot farthest to the east and the beach stretched 8 km. Sword beach was about 15 km away from Caen. When the British first landed there was almost no fire. As they advanded, though, they ran into heavily defended areas. This group was the only one to be attacked by a German Panzer devision on the 6th.

                Juno Beach was located in between Gold and Sword Beach. It was also called the Canadian beach because the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division was assigned to it. Although it was the Canadian Infantry, it was under British control until July 1944. Even though the Canadians had significant numbers on the beach, there was also a good number of British soldiers there too. The naval part of this invasion was called Force J.

                About 0830, Winters gathered a team of thirteen men from his and other companies. Knowing little more than a general location of the gun emplacement, his team scouted the area north of a farm house called BrÃ©court Manor, located 3 miles west of Utah Beach, just south of a small village Le Grand-Chemin (near Sainte-Marie-du-Mont). There they spotted a battery of four 105 mm guns connected by a trench network and defended by nests of MG42 machine guns. In total, they were up against about sixty German soldiers

            <h2>Aftermath</h2>
            <p>
                The Normandy landings were the largest seaborne invasion in history, with nearly 5,000 landing and assault craft, 289 escort vessels, and 277 minesweepers participating. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on D-Day, with 875,000 men disembarking by the end of June. Allied casualties on the first day were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead. The Germans lost 1,000 men. The Allied invasion plans had called for the capture of Carentan, Saint-LÃ´, Caen, and Bayeux on the first day, with all the beaches (other than Utah) linked with a front line 10 to 16 kilometres (6 to 10 mi) from the beaches; none of these objectives was achieved. The five beachheads were not connected until 12 June, by which time the Allies held a front around 97 kilometres (60 mi) long and 24 kilometres (15 mi) deep. Caen, a major objective, was still in German hands at the end of D-Day and would not be completely captured until 21 July. The Germans had ordered French civilians other than those deemed essential to the war effort to leave potential combat zones in Normandy. Civilian casualties on D-Day and D+1 are estimated at 3,000.
