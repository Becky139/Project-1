## Introduction

This is a website looking at some of the amazing stories of WW2 meny had a major impact in turning the tide against the Nazis and helped the allies to win the war.

The Idea came from an intrest i have had since i was small and was peaked when i joined the Armed forces and served 9 years myself. These stories had a big impact on me showing the courage and bravery people enjured to overcome one of the most brutel and savage regimes the world has faced.

This website was made for the first of five Milestone projects required to complete the Diploma in Software development (eCommerce Applications) program at The Code Institute.

The main requirements of this project are to build a responsive and static front-end site to present useful information to users using all the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5 and CSS3. The site is to contain no less than three pages.
