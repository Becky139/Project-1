## Introduction

This is a website looking at some of the amazing stories of WW2 meny had a major impact in turning the tide against the Nazis and helped the allies to win the war.

The Idea came from an intrest i have had since i was small and was peaked when i joined the Armed forces and served 9 years myself. These stories had a big impact on me showing the courage and bravery people enjured to overcome one of the most brutel dictatorships in history.

This website was made for the first of five Milestone projects required to complete the Diploma in Software development (eCommerce Applications) program at The Code Institute.

The main requirements of this project are to build a responsive and static front-end site to present useful information to users using all the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5 and CSS3. The site is to contain no less than three pages.

## Features

### Design Features
Each page within the site has a consistent and responsive navigation system. The details of features on the site are detailed below.
- The **Header** is across the top of the page. It is not static as this would cover too much of the screen. A back-to-top button was implemented instead so users can access the navigation bar quickly.
- The **Navigation Bar** is positioned directly below the header. The navigation bar is only used for screen sizes larger than 1200px. It is then replaced by a hamburger menu.
- The **Navigation Bar** collapses into a **Hamburger Menu** that, when clicked or tapped, opens a sidebar which shows the navigation options.
- The **Footer** is 100% in width and 40px in height. It stays at the bottom of the screen at all times, on all screen sizes. Each social media link opens in a new tab. Additionally, each social media link opens a zombie related link on each respective Each page within the site has a consistent and responsive navigation system.
