        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
        <p>World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—forming two opposing military
          alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. In a total war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war
          effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the only two uses of nuclear weapons in war. World War II was by
          far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of
          the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.
    
          These are some of the biggest and most sercret stories of the war meny deatils of these were kept from public knowledge for more than 50 years after the war ended.</p>

        <h2>D Day</h2>
        <p>During World War II (1939-1945), the Battle of Normandy, which lasted from June 1944 to August 1944, resulted in the Allied liberation of Western Europe from Nazi Germany’s control. Codenamed Operation Overlord, the battle began on June 6,
          1944, also known as D-Day, when some 156,000 American, British and Canadian forces landed on five beaches along a 50-mile stretch of the heavily fortified coast of France’s Normandy region. The invasion was one of the largest amphibious
          military assaults in history and required extensive planning. Prior to D-Day, the Allies conducted a large-scale deception campaign designed to mislead the Germans about the intended invasion target. By late August 1944, all of northern France
          had been liberated, and by the following spring the Allies had defeated the Germans. The Normandy landings have been called the beginning of the end of war in Europe</p>
    
        <h4>Preparing for D-Day</h4>
    
        <p>After World War II began, Germany invaded and occupied northwestern France beginning in May 1940. The Americans entered the war in December 1941, and by 1942 they and the British (who had been evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk in May 1940
          after being cut off by the Germans in the Battle of France) were considering the possibility of a major Allied invasion across the English Channel. The following year, Allied plans for a cross-Channel invasion began to ramp up. In November
          1943, Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), who was aware of the threat of an invasion along France’s northern coast, put Erwin Rommel (1891-1944) in charge of spearheading defense operations in the region, even though the Germans did not know exactly
          where the Allies would strike. Hitler charged Rommel with finishing the Atlantic Wall, a 2,400-mile fortification of bunkers, landmines and beach and water obstacles.In January 1944, General Dwight Eisenhower (1890-1969) was appointed commander
          of Operation Overlord. In the months and weeks before D-Day, the Allies carried out a massive deception operation intended to make the Germans think the main invasion target was Pas-de-Calais (the narrowest point between Britain and France)
          rather than Normandy. In addition, they led the Germans to believe that Norway and other locations were also potential invasion targets. Many tactics were used to carry out the deception, including fake equipment; a phantom army commanded by
          George Patton and supposedly based in England, across from Pas-de-Calais; double agents; and fraudulent radio transmissions.</p>
    
        <h4>A Weather Delay: June 5, 1944</h4>
        <p>Eisenhower selected June 5, 1944, as the date for the invasion; however, bad weather on the days leading up to the operation caused it to be delayed for 24 hours. On the morning of June 5, after his meteorologist predicted improved conditions
          for the following day, Eisenhower gave the go-ahead for Operation Overlord. He told the troops: “You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you.”Later that day,
          more than 5,000 ships and landing craft carrying troops and supplies left England for the trip across the Channel to France, while more than 11,000 aircraft were mobilized to provide air cover and support for the invasion.</p>
      </div>
    
      <h4>D-Day Landings: June 6, 1944</h4>
    
      <p>By dawn on June 6, thousands of paratroopers and glider troops were already on the ground behind enemy lines, securing bridges and exit roads. The amphibious invasions began at 6:30 a.m. The British and Canadians overcame light opposition to
        capture beaches codenamed Gold, Juno and Sword, as did the Americans at Utah Beach. U.S. forces faced heavy resistance at Omaha Beach, where there were over 2,000 American casualties. However, by day’s end, approximately 156,000 Allied troops had
        successfully stormed Normandy’s beaches. According to some estimates, more than 4,000 Allied troops lost their lives in the D-Day invasion, with thousands more wounded or missing.Less than a week later, on June 11, the beaches were fully secured
        and over 326,000 troops, more than 50,000 vehicles and some 100,000 tons of equipment had landed at Normandy.
    
        For their part, the Germans suffered from confusion in the ranks and the absence of celebrated commander Rommel, who was away on leave. At first, Hitler, believing the invasion was a feint designed to distract the Germans from a coming attack
        north of the Seine River, refused to release nearby divisions to join the counterattack. Reinforcements had to be called from further afield, causing delays. He also hesitated in calling for armored divisions to help in the defense. Moreover, the
        Germans were hampered by effective Allied air support, which took out many key bridges and forced the Germans to take long detours, as well as efficient Allied naval support, which helped protect advancing Allied troops.
    
        In the ensuing weeks, the Allies fought their way across the Normandy countryside in the face of determined German resistance, as well as a dense landscape of marshes and hedgerows. By the end of June, the Allies had seized the vital port of
        Cherbourg, landed approximately 850,000 men and 150,000 vehicles in Normandy, and were poised to continue their march across France.</p>

        <h2>Operation Mincemeat</h2>
        <p>During World War II, British intelligence officers managed to pull off one of the most successful wartime deceptions ever achieved: Operation Mincemeat. In April 1943, a decomposing corpse was discovered floating off the coast of Huelva, in
          southern Spain. Personal documents identified him as Major William Martin of Britain’s Royal Marines, and he had a black attaché case chained to his wrist. When Nazi intelligence learned of the downed officer’s briefcase (as well as concerted
          efforts made by the British to retrieve the case), they did all they could to gain access. Though Spain was officially neutral in the conflict, much of its military was pro-German, and the Nazis were able to find an officer in Madrid to help
          them. In addition to other personal effects and official-looking documents, they found a letter from military authorities in London to a senior British officer in Tunisia, indicating that Allied armies were preparing to cross the Mediterranean
          from their positions in North Africa and attack German-held Greece and Sardinia.
    
          This intelligence coup for the Nazi spy network allowed Adolf Hitler to transfer German troops from France to Greece ahead of what was believed to be a massive enemy invasion. The only problem? It was all a hoax. The “drowned” man was actually
          a Welsh tramp whose body was obtained in a London morgue by British intelligence officers Charles Cholmondeley and Ewen Montagu, the brains behind Operation Mincemeat. After creating an elaborate fake identity and backstory for “William
          Martin,” Cholmondeley and Montagu got Charles Fraser-Smith (thought to be the model for Q in the James Bond novels, written by former British naval intelligence officer Ian Fleming) to design a special container to preserve the body during its
          time in the water. One of England’s leading racecar drivers transported the container to a Royal Navy submarine, which dropped it off the Spanish coast. Once the Spanish recovered the body, British authorities began their frantic attempts to
          recover the case, counting on the fact that their efforts would convince the Nazis of the documents’ validity. As a result of the false intelligence carried by “William Martin,” the Nazis were caught unawares when 160,000 Allied troops invaded
          Sicily on July 10, 1943. In addition to saving thousands of Allied soldiers’ lives, Operation Mincemeat helped further Italian leader Benito Mussolini’s downfall and turn the tide of the war towards an Allied victory in Europe.</p>

        <h2>Breaking Enigma</h2>
        <p>Of the many top secret operations conducted by secret service agents in World War II, there is no doubt that the breaking of the German Enigma code was the one that gave the Allies the greatest strategic advantage in the war. But the task of
          finally decoding this highly complex system was not without a lot of effort of the finest minds that could be put against the task. It was a massive operation at times requiring the services of over 500 people all working in absolute secrecy at
          Bletchley Park in Great Britain.The task of breaking coded German communications began as early as 1938. At first the lower level codes were not difficult as they depended on coding schemes that the Germans had been using for decades. But as
          war approached, the complexity as well as the quantity of coded messages presented a serious challenge to secret service agents in World War II. The new code was nicknamed Enigma because it was so difficult to decrypt. It was a machine
          generated code using mathematical ciphers to make each transmission very difficult to decode without the necessary equipment at hand.Throughout World War II, there was another front of the battle that went on along with the open warfare and
          that was the military objective of capturing German Enigma decoding machines. Stories of the capture of the machines or coding books to help Allied secret service agents to break the Enigma code are legendary. The quest to conquer these codes
          was one of the most monumental efforts that was mounted throughout the conflict and yet it was one that was conducted in such complete secrecy that the German intelligence community never realized the code was in danger of being broken.
    
          The nonstop effort to break the Enigma code yielded success steadily but very slowly. The top secret project to crack this code at Bletchley Park was named Ultra. Even when the code was understood, the process of decrypting a message took hours
          for each Ultra agent calling for long and tedious effort. While not all decrypted messages yielded real military treasures, the strategic advantage of being able to “listen in” on the messages being sent between German military planners was
          what made the difference in the Allies ability to stay one step ahead of the Nazi’s and eventually win World War II.
    
          Along with the tedious effort that each decryption task called for, the process of collecting German communications to feed the Ultra project was difficult and sometimes unreliable. Allied intelligence agencies staffed thousands of intercept
          stations all over Europe. The Germans were crafty in how they constantly changed frequencies, or shifted how and where they sent messages from to keep their enemies guessing. The task of staying on top of German communications methods to
          intercept Enigma coded messages was as difficult as the decrypting process itself.
          The difficulty of learning German intelligence secrets threatened to become too overwhelming as the tempo of the war picked up and the number of communications being intercepted went from a few dozen to hundreds a day. One of the huge
          breakthroughs of the war effort came when British Engineers Alan Turing and Tommy Flowers created “The Colossus”, a precursor to the modern mainframe computer that made it possible to accurately break hundreds of encrypted messages each day
          without the intense manual effort. With The Colossus as part of our strategic military advantage, Allied military planners had what they needed to know well in advance where Hitler was going to strike and to determine to what extent the Axis
          powers were prepared for invasion plans being devised by the United States, Britain and their allies.
    
          Many of the great stories of how we were able to distract German military movements and cause Hitler to send his troops to the wrong location were made possible by the knowledge we got from breaking the Enigma code. That one secret service
          accomplishment may be just as significant a scientific breakthrough that brought an early end to World War II as the development of the atomic bomb.
